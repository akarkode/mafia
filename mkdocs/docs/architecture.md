ğŸ“ˆ System Architecture

ğŸ”¥ How MAFIA Works

1. Incoming Request â†’ Logs metadata (IP, Path).
2. Rate Limiting â†’ If request exceeds threshold, itâ€™s blocked.
3. Payload Filtering â†’ Detects XSS & SQLi patterns.
4. Brute Force Detection â†’ 
    - Uses Isolation Forest trained on attempt_count and avg_interval_between_attempts.
    - Calculates normalized risk score.
5. Decision â†’ If risk_score > 0.8, request is blocked.
