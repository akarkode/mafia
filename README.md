# üìö MAFIA - Middleware AI Firewall Application

MAFIA (Middleware AI Firewall Application) is a lightweight yet powerful Python library that integrates seamlessly into modern web frameworks to protect applications from common security threats.

üì¶ Features

- AI-Powered Brute Force Attack Detection (Isolation Forest)
- Rate Limiting using Redis
- Malicious Payload Filtering (XSS & SQL Injection Patterns)
- Risk Scoring Based on Multi-Feature Input (Attempts & Interval Timing)
- Metadata Tracking & Model Versioning
- FastAPI Compatible Middleware

üìö Installation

1. Install Directly from GitHub using Pip

   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/akarkode/mafia.git
   ```
   
2. Integrate into FastAPI Project
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from mafia.middleware import BruteForceMiddleware

   app = FastAPI()
   app.add_middleware(BruteForceMiddleware, redis_url="redis://localhost:6379")

   @app.get("/")
   def home():
   return {"message": "Hello from MAFIA-protected API!"}
   ```

üöÄ How It Works

1. Incoming Request ‚Üí MAFIA logs request metadata (IP, Path).
2. Rate Limiting ‚Üí If request count exceeds limit, request is blocked.
3. Payload Inspection ‚Üí Checks for malicious patterns in query parameters (XSS, SQL Injection).
4. Brute Force Detection (AI) ‚Üí
   - Uses Isolation Forest trained on attempt_count and avg_interval_between_attempts.
   - Produces a risk score using min-max normalization.
5. Risk Decision ‚Üí
   - If risk_score > 0.8, request is blocked.
   - Otherwise, request proceeds to application logic.

üìö Advantages

- AI-Driven Detection (Adapts to new attack patterns)
- Lightweight and Easy to Integrate
- Centralized Logging and Risk Scoring
- Easy Monitoring and Extendable

---

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Not Suitable for High-Throughput APIs
- Requires Redis for State Management
- Needs Periodic Model Retraining for Optimal Accuracy
- Not a Replacement for Proper Authentication & Validation Layers
